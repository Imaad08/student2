    "## What Exactly is a Database?\n",
    "> Anatomy and use of a database and why it is useful for flask login page\n",
    "\n",
    "### Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going into flask login pages, one unit we will need to interact with is a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What is a database?\n",
    "A: A database is basically just a place to store organized data. Usually this hapens in the forms of values stored in columns inside tables. Think Microsoft Excel\n",
    "\n",
    "So basically, it is a running unit on your server or machine to which you can append values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main types of databases consist of RDBMS databases (relational databases) and Document-oriented databases. Both of these databases are used in their own cases as they have different algorithms and functions for sorting values or handling values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of the login page, we will be focusing on relational **databases**\n",
    "\n",
    "![db](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shuban-789/Markdown-images/main/what-is-a-database.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Databases for Login Page\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Well what does this have to do with a login page?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well what is a piece of data that needs to be stored everytime? Usernames and passwords of course.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can store usernames and passwords in databases. If we store usernames and passwords in the same unit, we can search for a username and retrieve a password\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other Tricks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Login Page Specifics\n",
    "\n",
    "1️⃣ In the model definition, a class is used. This class basically has attributes such as the main init function with argument self, and passwords, username, and uid. When all of these are called, they are called as self.password or self.username.\n",
    "\n",
    "2️⃣ The Database is basically just a session running on a server. Whenever a change is made, `db.session.commit()` is used\n",
    "\n",
    "3️⃣ Basically, object user is accessed with all these attributes. So if given say a username, there will be a search for that username's uid assigned and its password.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced security\n",
    "\n",
    "Not secure\n",
    "```py\n",
    "password = \"ilikecheese123\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def authentication(passw):\n",
    "    if passw == password:\n",
    "        return True\n",
    "while 1:\n",
    "  attempt = str(input(\"Enter the password: \"))\n",
    "  if authentication(attempt) == True:\n",
    "      print(\"Access Granted\")\n",
    "  else:\n",
    "      print(\"Access Denied\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is not secure because:\n",
    "- If an attacker got their hands onto the source code for this, or in our case our database got leaked, all the passwords would be revealed in plaintext\n",
    "- Can be easily bruteforced. No bruteforce protection\n",
    "\n",
    "Better\n",
    "```py\n",
    "import time\n",
    "\n",
    "password = \"ilikecheese123\"\n",
    "failed_attempts = 0\n",
    "lock_time = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "def authentication(passw):\n",
    "    if passw == password:\n",
    "        return True\n",
    "while 1:\n",
    "  attempt = str(input(\"Enter the password: \"))\n",
    "  if authentication(attempt) == True:\n",
    "      print(\"Access Granted\")\n",
    "  else:\n",
    "      print(\"Access Denied\")\n",
    "      failed_attempts += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "  if failed_attempts%3 == 0:\n",
    "    if lock_time == 0:\n",
    "      lock_time = lock_time+1\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "      lock_time = lock_time*2\n",
    "    print(\"You have been locked out for\", lock_time, \"seconds\")\n",
    "    time.sleep(lock_time)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code solves the problem of bruteforcing using a lockout policy. But it does not really help if an attacker gets access to the dartabase or in this case, the source code. For that, python has vast username and password management libraries with builtin hashing. \n",
