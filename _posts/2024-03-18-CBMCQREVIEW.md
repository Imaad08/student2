# Scores

![Scores](image.png)

- The 2020 MC is the one I took last trimester
- I scored a 65/70 on the 2021 exam
- This is a sizeable increase from last trimester in terms of percent

# Test corrections

![Q28](image-1.png)

- Here I got confused on which of the two variables would be negative
- If J was -5 and K was 5, -5 would be added 5 times which results in -25
- **The correct answer is D because the value of k will repeatedly decrement by 1 inside the loop until k = 0. If k is initially negative, it will continue to decrease without ever reaching**

![Q38](image-2.png)

- I was completely stumped on this question and just took my best guess
- **D is the corrrect answer becase simulations are most useful when real-world events are impractical. A simulation is unlikely to be appropriate if continuous real-world data is needed**

![Q55](image-3.png)

- I forgot the difference between append and insert
- I thought append did what inserts function is
- **The correct answer is C because that code segment assigns the value of the last element of the list to the variable temp, then removes the last element of the list, then inserts temp as the first element of the list**

- I didn't know what the second answer could have been
- Took an educated guess which was wrong
- **The correct answer is D because in that code segment, if timer is greater than 60, bonus is assigned 1500 in the first IF block. If timer is between 30 and 60, inclusive, bonus is assigned 1000 in the second IF block. If timer is less than 30, bonus is assigned 500 in the third IF block. The correct number of bonus points is assigned to bonus for all possible values of timer**

![Q70](image-5.png)

- This question was severely rushed as I thought it needed to be submitted before lunch and the bell was about to ring any minute
- I confused D with C
- **The correct answer is C because that code segment assigns the characters to the left of position n to newStr. The code segment then concatenates newStr with the substring consisting of the characters to the right of position n. For example, if oldStr is "best" and n is 3, the code segment assigns "be" to newStr, then concatenates "be" and the substring "t" and assigns the result "bet" to newStr**

# Reflection

- My coding and logic skills are improving and the 2021 MCQ was a good source of help
- The amount of coding I have done since last trimester has shown a steady increase in scores
- Working in teams was very helpful
- Some concepts like append and insert were lost to me and I need to do a review on pseudo code
- I am pretty happy with where I am at right now in terms of knowledge and practice test scores
- I am excited to see how this year goes for my skills
