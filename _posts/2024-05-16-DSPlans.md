# Stock Simulator

## Introduction

We plan on creating a stock simulator game allows users to practice trading stocks without risking real money. Our simulator will provide a realistic trading experience, featuring real-time stock prices, portfolio management, and performance tracking.

## 1. Algorithmic Loops

### List Comprehension

In our stock simulator, we need to manage lists of stocks, users, and transactions. List comprehension is an efficient way to build these lists.

```python
# List of stock prices
stock_prices = [stock['price'] for stock in stocks if stock['symbol'] in user_portfolio]
```

### Processing Lists

We will demonstrate two methods of processing a list: conventional loops and the `for each` method.

#### Conventional Loop

```python
# Calculate total portfolio value
total_value = 0
for stock in user_portfolio:
    total_value += stock['quantity'] * stock['price']
```

#### For Each Method

```python
# Calculate total portfolio value using sum() and a generator expression
total_value = sum(stock['quantity'] * stock['price'] for stock in user_portfolio)
```

## 2. Sorting and Searching

### Sorting

Sorting is crucial for displaying stocks in an organized manner. We'll use SQLAlchemy for database queries, which allows efficient sorting.

```python
# Query to sort stocks by price
sorted_stocks = session.query(Stock).order_by(Stock.price.desc()).all()
```

### Searching

Searching for stocks or transactions is another common operation. We can utilize SQLAlchemyâ€™s filtering capabilities.

```python
# Query to find a specific stock by symbol
stock = session.query(Stock).filter_by(symbol='AAPL').first()
```

## 3. Big(O) Notation

Understanding the time and space complexity of our algorithms is vital for ensuring the scalability of our application.

### Time Complexity

- Sorting stocks using SQLAlchemy: O(n log n)
- Searching for a stock by symbol: O(1) (assuming an indexed column)

### Space Complexity

- Sorting: O(n) (temporary storage for the sorted list)
- Searching: O(1) (constant space for the result)

## 4. 2D Iteration

In some cases, we need to process data in a tabular format. For example, generating a report of user transactions.

```python
# 2D iteration over a matrix of transactions
transactions = [
    {'user': 'Alice', 'stock': 'AAPL', 'quantity': 10},
    {'user': 'Bob', 'stock': 'GOOGL', 'quantity': 5},
]

for transaction in transactions:
    for key, value in transaction.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

## 5. Deployment

### Full Stack Deployment

Deploying our stock simulator involves setting up a web server, database, and front-end application. We'll use Flask for the backend, SQLAlchemy for ORM, and HTML/JavaScript for the frontend.

#### Backend (Flask)

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

app = Flask(__name__)

# Setup the database connection
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///stocks.db')
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

@app.route('/stocks')
def get_stocks():
    stocks = session.query(Stock).all()
    return jsonify([stock.to_dict() for stock in stocks])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

#### Frontend (HTML/JavaScript)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Stock Simulator</title>
    <script>
        async function fetchStocks() {
            const response = await fetch('/stocks');
            const stocks = await response.json();
            const stocksList = document.getElementById('stocksList');
            stocksList.innerHTML = '';
            stocks.forEach(stock => {
                const listItem = document.createElement('li');
                listItem.textContent = `${stock.symbol}: $${stock.price}`;
                stocksList.appendChild(listItem);
            });
        }

        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', fetchStocks);
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Stock Simulator</h1>
    <ul id="stocksList"></ul>
</body>
</html>
```

### Simultaneous Use and Updates

Our deployment plan includes enabling multiple users to interact with the simulator simultaneously. This involves setting up a robust database, ensuring API endpoints are efficient, and handling concurrent requests effectively.

### Conclusion

This plan outlines the essential components and code snippets for developing a stock simulator game. By following these guidelines, we can create a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly application that provides a realistic stock trading experience without financial risk. Stay tuned for further updates as we move forward with the implementation!
