# Week 0 Lab Notebook

## Who am I? Page Description

While creating the Who am I? page, I was trying to put as much information about be as I could so that people reading my page could get to know me better.

### Problems:
> • I had some trouble creating the table that displayed my classes because I wasn't 100% sure how to make it.

### Solution:
> • After reading slack announcements, I saw that Mr. Mortensen had sent out an announcement that showed us how to create the tables. I used this information to create the table that is not on my home page.

### Skills used/learned:
> • I learned the HTML language a little better because I understood how different lines could be made to make a table using just a few lines of code
