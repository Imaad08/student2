# Github project
All features are currently being tracked using a [Github Project](https://github.com/users/Imaad08/projects/1)
# Overall Project

- A easy-to-use site for making simple interent memes. The user should be able to create a meme with a top and bottom text and then have the choice to add it to a a database of memes. This will be then added to a gallery for all to see. On top of this we want to incroporate a user/admin login system.

- Homepage:

# Feature 1: Meme Creator -

- This is the "Main Event" of the website

- It takes in an image, top text, bottom text, converts the image to base64 data, and sends the data to the backend

- Using Python Pillow, the base64 data is converted back into an image, the text is added onto the image and then the image is turned back into base64 data to be sent to the frontend

- The frontend takes the base64 data and displays the result as a normal image as a full meme

# Feature 2: Meme Gallery -

- This feature will be comlpetley oriented towards users especially during Night at Mueseum.

- It will showcase created memes (taken from the database) and display them in large sizes.

- In the meme creator if the user opted out of adding their meme to their database, even though they made one it won't be disp

- If you click an image you get a preview of the image that's more clear to see. If you choose to do so when you hover over the image you get an download button which lets you download any meme regardless if or if not u created it.

- Potential design:

# Feature 3: User/Admin Login -

- Users can sign up, login, and delete their accounts thanks to JWT with python

- When creating an account, the default role is user but some accounts have admin access which allow them to see a data table of all the users and their info

- The admin can delete any user account and edit the database of memes, being able to delete anything

- Users will have less access and will not be able to edit database or view user accounts with a 403 redirect

- Figma Design:

  <style>
    .image-container {
      display: flex;
    }
    .image-container img {
      margin-right: 10px; 
      width: 200px; 
    }
      </style>

    <div class="image-container">

    </div>

# Feature 4: Meme Database -

- When creating a meme, the user can choose to add it to the public database or not

- If added to the db, the meme is stored inside of an sqlite database that holds all the details about the image including the base64 data

- The database can be accessed by the admin and the user accounts however the admins should get more access and extra information
