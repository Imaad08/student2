# Week 2 Lab Notebook:

---

## Game of life description:
I added the code for the game from the source provided in Slack announcments and added some styles to make it look more visually appealing.

### Problems:
> • There was a buggy line in the source but when added to the code to run on the website, it would not work. I was also unable to paste in the line here without the page crashing.
>
> • When scrolling, the text, `Remix of game of life` would stay constant on the screen and would overlap with all elements of the website

### Solutions:
> • Removing the line was able to fix the website and it would continue to run properly
>
> • I removed the text element in the `HTML` code that contained the buggy text and the overlapping stopped

### Skills used/learned:
> • Editing `HTML` code to fix overlapping text errors
>
> • Using `CSS` to apply styles to the buttons

## Phone data table description:
I used the code from the JsOuput table to create my own table that contained the data of phone companies, models, release years, color, and price. I then added a little bit of styling to make more appealing.

### Problems:
> • I encountered an issue where the search bar overlapped with the data table values most likely due to the fact that I styled the head of the table

### Solutions:
> • In my `CSS` styles, I added a margin so that the search bar would be moved further up

### Skills used/learned:
> • Editing `HTML` to change table values
>
> • Adding and modifying `CSS` to style the table and fix visual issues

## Snake game description:
Using the source code for the snake game, I was able to add a playable and fully functioning snake game into the website.

### Problems:
> • On both localhost and github pages, I was unable to load the game page for some reason and the tab would time out

### Solutions:
> • I switched browsers and the page started working. It was an issue that only occured on Chrome

### Skills used/learned:
> • Adding `HTML` code to put a functioning snake game into the website

## Stock protfolio simulator description:
For this project, me and Tanay decided to collaborate on one big Python project that would allow us to pull and display stock data in a table using the `pandas` module and `Stooq` database. We also worked on a project to show this data on a graph but as of right now it does not fully work.

### Problems:
> • We wanted to use as many simulations as possible so we moved the number to around 15,000 simulations
>
> • The code kept timing out and couldn't fully execute the code but we found out our computers couldn't handle that many since they started lagging and heating up

### Solutions:
> • We learned that 6000 was an optimal number of simulations for both accuracy and cost on computers

### Skills used/learned:
> • We used the `Pandas` module to express the data of stock prices which was pulled
>
> • We used the `Stooq` database which we pulled data of 8 stocks from
>
> • We used `Python` to code functions that would allow us to use the modules from above
