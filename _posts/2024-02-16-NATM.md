# Reflection

Night at the musuem was a nice and fun oppertunity. We got to present our meme editor from 6:30 - 7. We got good advice, feedback, and compliments which we were proud of based on the work and time we spent. 'Meme Forge' lets users upload an image, top text, bottom text, and the choice to add to the public database of memes, then using python Pillow, it creates a meme. A lot of the people at N@TM had a lot of fun creating their own funny memes. We also got feedback on how we should make our frontend look better and polish the backend code because it was glitchy at times

# Feedback

- Make text bigger
- Make memes bigger
- Easier navigation
- More customization beyong top and bottom text
- Use more styling to make a better looking frontend

Over break, we will be implemeneting these changes in order to be ready for college board. User experience is very important so it is our top priority for these changes

# Something impressive in CompSci

I really liked the clash royale site because I personally play the game and am always looking for better decks to play with. I think this site is a great idea because it gives a personalized deck that I can use based on how I play the game. This was a really intricate project and I would like to know what the process was behind it.

# Something outside of CompSci

Before my presentation time, I looked at the 3D animation section and I saw a really nice blender render of a room that looked really realistic. Having taken the class before myself, I was blown away by the stunning amount of realism.
