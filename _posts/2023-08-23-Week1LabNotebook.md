# Week 1 Lab Notebook

---

## Python quiz description:
While exploring `Jupyter Notebook`, I was able to go through the python code for the quiz and see how it worked. I saw that a function needed to be defined in order for the quiz to function, so I defined it and the quiz worked properly. I then used Jupyter Notebook to put that python code into my website

## Problems:

- The quiz questions were quite easy and didn't take any real thought to answer.

- The answers had to be case sensitive and could be annoying for some users who made the first letter capital


## Solution:

- I brainstormed new quiz problems and edited the list of questions that already existed

- I used `elif` to add the different variations of capital letters for the answers

## Skills used/learned:

- I learned how to use `Jupyter Notebook` to add python code to the website with cells

- I used the `elif` function in python to add variations of the correct answer.

## Calculator description:
I wanted to add a calculator to my website so I decided to code one using `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. The calculator design was inspired by the apple calculator on iPhone's. I wanted to have a current operation display and a previous one right above it in smaller font that displayed the last function.

## Problems:

- I had a visual issue where whenever I clicked a new operation, the current function would move to the previous function area without clicking the equals button

- The JavaScript logic was complicated and took a while to make

## Solutions:

- I deleted the previous operation div entirely which took away a lot of unnecessary complexity and made it easier to create the calculator

- I simplified the JavaScript by just using the eval function to evaulate the current operation whenever the user clicks the equal button

## Skills used/learned:

- I learned how to use `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` to create a simple GUI based calculator

- I used the `eval` function in `JavaScript` to evaluate the current operation and display the new answer

- I used `HTML` tags to call the function to evaluate whenever the user clicks the equals button
