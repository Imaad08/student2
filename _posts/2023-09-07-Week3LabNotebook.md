# Week 3 Lab Notebook

---

## Weather Lookup description:
I wanted to have at least one project that used an API key for something and I decided that doing a weather app would be the most convenient. Using an OpenWeatherMap API key, I was able to fetch weather data from any city that was inputted and display the results

### Problems:

> • The JavaScript code was very complex as it had to collect all the input data and form a URL using the API key and all input data so that it could fetch data from the resulting webpage
>
> • For my first few attempts, the correct link was not able to be formed and would not display data


### Solution:

> • I did some research on Stack Overflow and found a simplified version of the code
>
> • After playing around with the link construction I was able to find a configuration that worked

### Skills used/learned:

> • I learned how to use `API Keys` to grab data from a source and display it on my webpage
>
> • I used `JavaScript` functions to automate all of this

## AI Story Generator:
I wanted to use Python to do something with AI and my idea originally started as an AI Rap song generator but it wouldn't rap and would instead provide stories based on a prompt. So using a pre-trained GPT-2 Model, I decided to just let it be a story generator and I gave it a prompt to expand on and it returned a full story

### Problems:

> • This process would take over 15 minutes to generate a full story
>
> • The Python code and model would have a heavy cost on the computers memory

### Solutions:

> • I simplified the code as much as I could and it took only 2 minutes and the memory usage was bearable


### Skills used/learned:

> • I learned how to call already existing AI models and create a story from a prompt
>
> • I used `Python` to code complex AI generators

## Cube Catcher
I watned to create a GUI based 2D JavaScript game and I decided that a 2D Cube that followed the mouse and collected other cubes was simple yet still required lots of code

### Problems:
> • The JavaScript logic wasn't working out the best and the cube would have a hard time following the mouse pointer
>
> • Falling cubes starting spawning outside of the container

### Solutions:
> • I used a better version of the mouse following logic and it started working correctly
>
> • I changed the styling so that any overflow of cubes would be hidden

### Skills used/learned:

> • I learned how to use `JavaScript` to code a game using complex logic

## Stacker
I wanted to create one of those arcade stacker games but didn't know where to start so I did some research and found a [Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwnbqXQSHXw){:target="_blank"} that explained how to use the P5 library to create the game. I followed the tutorial step by step and made a simillar product to what is in the video. I also added a start and stop button.

### Problems:
> • I didn't know what to do to start making the game

### Solutions:
> • I found a tutorial that showed me how to make the game


### Skills used/learned:

> • I learned what P5 js library is and how to use it to make creative games

## Linux Script
Since creating Linux interaction is VS Code was on the pair showcase rubric I decided to create a simple file management script that allows the user to quickly move, copy, delete, or organize their files

### Problems:
> • I had to look at several different websites to see how scripts in Linux work

### Solutions:
> • After looking at sources I understood how they worked and was able to make a fairly simple script that just did 1 of 4 operations based on user input


### Skills used/learned:

> • I learned how to write Linux bash scripts
