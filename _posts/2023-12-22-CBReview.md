# My Score:

<ul class = "bullet-points">
  <li>My score on the college board mc was a 59/67</li>
</ul>

# Journey:
<ul class = "bullet-points">
  <li>The team teaches were a lot more helpful this trimester than last trimester as people knew what to do at this point</li>
  <li>I was able to get a lot more done this trimester than last trimester</li>
  <li>I have noticed that I have gotten used to the classroom enviornment and teaching style which has led me to be able to learn faster</li>
  <li>I also come from a computer science background and have seen a lot of simillar questions from problems I have done before</li>
  <li>Some of the ethical concern problems were a little challenging to me</li>
</ul>

# Corrections:

### Question 2:
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/x3N7WXM/SCR-20231222-tqtv.png" alt="SCR-20231222-tqtv">
The correct answer was D. I chose B because I misunderstood what the question was asking and chose the least accurate one insteasd of the most accurate which would have been with multiple citizens

### Question 11:
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/tqR1VMv/SCR-20231222-trvp.png" alt="SCR-20231222-trvp">
The correct answer was A. I chose B because I thought the problem would be easy and just did mental math which turned out to give me the wrong answer

### Question 16
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/dm0KdDn/SCR-20231222-tssn.png" alt="SCR-20231222-tssn">
The correct answer was D. When I was examining the code, I thought that if I added an index-1 in between lines 6 and 7, it would terminate. But that would be inside the if statement and still not terminate, therefore D was correct.

### Question 23
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/rd3ZNkk/Question-23.png" alt="Question-23">
The correct answer was D.  This is becuse the flowchart sets available to true whenever weekday is true and miles is less than 20. And it sets available to false otherwise.

### Question 35
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/bLDbxBs/SCR-20231222-tuoq.png" alt="SCR-20231222-tuoq">
The correct answer is B. This is because for C, the MaxFor procedure calculates the max of multiple numbers but doesn't generalize it for any number

### Question 39
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/7tp970h/SCR-20231222-tvex.png" alt="SCR-20231222-tvex">
The correct answer is C. This is because the first element on the list is not included so lines 5 and 6 hould be switched

### Question 42
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/C9JWcfw/SCR-20231222-tvyw.png" alt="SCR-20231222-tvyw">
The correct answer is D. The boolean will not work correctly with C because when the score is below the target, at some point the boolean with return false when it should return true

### Question 52
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/sKgz5gt/SCR-20231222-twsy.png" alt="SCR-20231222-twsy">
The correct answer is A. This is because statement two is false because the simulation displays change of the population, not the population at the end.

## Concepts I struggled with:

<ul class = "bullet-points">
  <li>Conceptual/ethical problems</li>
  <li>Digital Divide</li>
  <li>Developing Algorithims</li>
  <li>Crowdsourcing</li>
</ul>

# Conclusion:
I feel like the score I got represents and reflects my journey in the class and showed me what I need to review for the AP exam. I now know that I need to work on my conceptual problems surrounding Digital Divide, developing algorithims, and crowdsourcing as those concepts were a little shakey on the quiz. I also know my strong points such as code based problems and internet related problems such as questions about IP routing. I will continue reveiwing college board concepts adn this quiz to prepare for the AP exam. Looking through the college board videos should prepare me well for the exam and I will try my hardest to absorb as much knowledge as I can so I can be more prepared and less reliant on previous instincts about computer science.
